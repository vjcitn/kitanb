Jupyter notebooks for HDF Kita + Bioconductor

## Introduction 

The JupyterHub at https://hdflab.hdfgroup.org provides infrastructure sufficient to use
the HDF Scalable Data Service with python or R in the context of jupyter notebooks.

The Bioconductor [rhdf5client](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/rhdf5client.html) and [restfulSE](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/restfulSE.html) packages can be used in R 3.5+ to work
seamlessly with HSDS-served HDF5 data in the "/shared/bioconductor" folder.
